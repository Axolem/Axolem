# Hi there 👋

I'm Axole Maranjana, a C# enthusiast and an explorer of the IT world. I love learning new frameworks, creating cool projects, and sharing my code on GitHub. I also enjoy kayaking, running, and listening to music. I think of myself as an adventurous coder.

## 🏆 My achievements

- Building a [task tracker app](https://github.com/Axolem/task-tracker) with React (it's not perfect, but it works)
- Contributing to 20 repositories on GitHub (some of them are mine, some of them are not)
- Having 1,565 contributions in the last year (I don't have a life, okay?)
- Being a PRO member of GitHub (I paid for it, so I might as well use it)
- Having 3 followers (I'm not famous, but I'm working on it)

## 🚀 Things I maintain
1. [React Native Ozow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ozow)
2. [React Native Payfast Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-payfast-plugin)
3. My PC 💻
4. And other things outside coding...

These are my stats. They are not impressive, but they are honest.


## 🛠️ My skills

- C# (it's king, don't @ me)
- JavaScript (it's everywhere, so I have to learn it)
- React (it's cool, but it makes me cry sometimes)
- ASP.NET Core (it's fast, powerful, and cross-platform)
- MySQL (it's flexible, scalable, and easy to use)
- TypeScript (it's JavaScript with types, what's not to love?)
- Tailwind CSS (it's a utility-first framework that makes styling a breeze)
